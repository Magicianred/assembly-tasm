# assembly-tasm
sharing some assembly codes that I wrote (TASM syntax) with their purposes.
I realised the resources are so limited while I was working with Assembly language, especially with TASM syntax. 
So I wanted to share my work for the ones who will learn about Assembly Language.
Hoping to help somebody to not struggle as much as I am :)
